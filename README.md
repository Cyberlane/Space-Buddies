Space-Buddies
=============
Affordable, fun & interactive kit that teaches you how to solder as well as writing code. Learn how Infrared, RGB LEDs and sound work!

The Hardware
============
The original kit makes use of an ATMega8 microcontroller in TQFP32 form factor, however is fully capable of being run with ATMega168 and ATMega328 chips of the same form factor.
Although the board is in fact Arduino compatible, the Space-Buddies game has yet to be fully ported over to Arduino code due to known bugs with Arduino and timers on the ATMega8 microcontroller.

The Story so far...
===================
After defeating the giant evil space bear Grizzlebutt, the Space Buddies were headed home to celebrate their victory. However, a wheel of fancy space cheese the size of a small asteroid hurled them off course, forcing them to crash land on the nearest planet: Earth.

The force of the mighty cheese wheel had knocked the ten Space Buddies so far apart that each one ended up in a completely different location on Earth in their musical spaceships of glory.

Unfortunately for the Space Buddies, the only way to get back to their home planet, Symphonia, was to open a hidden space gateway known as Vortex in G Minor. This special vortex could only be opened when all ten of their spaceships played their unique tune together.

Now they need your help to bring them together and re-establish communication. By collecting all ten tunes you can send them back on their journey home!
