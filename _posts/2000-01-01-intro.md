### Introduction
Space-Buddies is an open source project created by me (Justin Nel), originally in 2014. The project was started off as an idea for a way to help people of all ages get into electronics. It was partially funded by Kickstarter and the remainder by myself.

I hit a number of obstacles in creating this project, a few more than I had originally expected, but I got there in the end!

## Please Note
An update for the website will be ariving within the next few days which will include links to download the PDF booklet, programming instructions, and usage instructions. My apologies for the delay!
