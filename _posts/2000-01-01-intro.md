### Introduction
Space-Buddies is an open source project created by me (Justin Nel), originally in 2014. The project was started off as an idea for a way to help people of all ages get into electronics. It was partially funded by Kickstarter and the remainder by myself.

I hit a number of obstacles in creating this project, a few more than I had originally expected, but I got there in the end!
